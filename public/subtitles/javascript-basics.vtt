Welcome to JavaScript Fundamentals. I'm going to show you the basics of JavaScript programming.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
JavaScript is a programming language that runs in the browser and on servers.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Let's start with variables. We can declare variables using let, const, or var.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The let keyword creates a block-scoped variable that can be reassigned.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The const keyword creates a constant that cannot be reassigned after declaration.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Here's an example: let message equals "Hello World".

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Functions are reusable blocks of code. We can declare them using the function keyword.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax: const add equals parentheses a comma b parentheses arrow a plus b.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Objects store multiple values as key-value pairs inside curly braces.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Arrays store ordered lists of items inside square brackets.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We can access object properties using dot notation or bracket notation.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Array methods like map, filter, and reduce help us manipulate data efficiently.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Conditional statements like if-else help us make decisions in our code.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Loops like for and while help us repeat operations multiple times.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
That covers the fundamental concepts of JavaScript programming.
