Welcome to this comprehensive introduction to React Hooks.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Before hooks, you had to write class components to use state and lifecycle methods.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The most commonly used hook is useState for managing component state.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Here's how to declare state: const [count, setCount] = useState(0).

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
useState returns an array with the current state value and a setter function.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The useEffect hook lets you perform side effects in functional components.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Use it for data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
useEffect runs after every render by default, but you can control this.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The dependency array in useEffect controls when the effect runs.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Custom hooks let you extract component logic into reusable functions.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Custom hook names must start with "use" and can call other hooks.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Other useful hooks include useContext, useReducer, and useMemo.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Always follow the Rules of Hooks: only call hooks at the top level.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Hooks make functional components more powerful and easier to test.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
That's your introduction to React Hooks. Happy coding!
